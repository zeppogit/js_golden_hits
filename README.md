This project utilizes the follow technology.

* Header with navigation options vertically aligned.  But via @media queries, switches to horizontal alignment for the navigation options beneath the header when viewport increases to 769px, and moves the navigation options to the same line as the header name when viewport sizes increases to 1025px and higher.

* Banner uses CSS @keyframes and :hover pseudo-class to animate logo when pointer hovers over it.

* Main content section with a "calendar" of monthly hits:

       * demonstrates use of flexbox to expand vertical mobile alignment into rows as increased viewport space allows.


ADDITIONAL JAVASCRIPT:

* Main content section with a "calendar" of monthly hits:

       * demonstrates use of a JavaScript 'for' loop to access an array in order to adhere to D.R.Y. programming and eliminate repetitive code.

* Reads and parses an external "about.json" file, displaying  data from that into the section providing more info about the hits. (The json content is derived from Wikipedia pages for each song.)


* Implements a regular expression (regex) to ensure an email input field is always entered the same format.
