* Password prompt demonstrates use of a Javascript do-while loop to search an array of correct passwords. Allows further access to webpage if there is a match.

* Header with navigation options vertically aligned.  But via @media queries, switches to horizontal alignment for the navigation options beneath the header when viewport increases to 769px, and moves the navigation options to the same line as the header name when viewport sizes increases to 1025px and higher.

* Banner uses CSS @keyframes and :hover pseudo-class to animate logo when pointer hovers over it.

* Main content section with a "calendar" of monthly hits:

       * demonstrates use of flexbox to expand vertical mobile alignment into rows as increased viewport space allows.

       * demonstrates use of a JavaScript for loop to adhere to D.R.Y. programming and eliminate repetitive code.
